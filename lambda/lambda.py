"""
Lambda handler for the AI Agent Insure RAG Knowledge Base.

How it fits into the architecture:
  React frontend (S3)
      → POST /chat  (API Gateway HTTP API)
          → this Lambda
              → Bedrock retrieve_and_generate
                  → S3 Vectors knowledge base
                      → Claude generates an answer
  ← answer + cited source documents returned to the browser

The request body must be JSON: {"query": "your question here"}
The response body is JSON:    {"query": "...", "generated_response": "...", "s3_locations": [...]}

Environment variables (set in the Lambda configuration panel):
  KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID    — the ID of your Bedrock Knowledge Base (e.g. "ABC123XYZ")
  FOUNDATION_MODEL_ARN — foundation model ARN for generation (Claude 3 Haiku, on-demand).
                         e.g. arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0

# Content-Type tells the browser the response body is JSON.

# The Access-Control-Allow-* headers are CORS headers. Browsers enforce a
# "same-origin policy" — by default a web page can only call APIs on the
# exact same domain it was served from. Since our React app is on S3 and the
# API is on a different domain (execute-api.amazonaws.com), the browser would
# block the request without these headers.
#
# The HTTP API Gateway handles the OPTIONS "preflight" request automatically
# via its own CORS config, so this Lambda never sees OPTIONS calls. However,
# returning these headers on the actual POST response as well is good practice
# — it acts as a fallback if the API Gateway CORS config is ever misconfigured.
